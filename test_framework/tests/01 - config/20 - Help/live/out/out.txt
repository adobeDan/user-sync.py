User Sync from Adobe

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --version         show program's version number and exit
  -t, --test-mode       run API action calls in test mode (does not execute
                        changes on the Adobe side). Logs what would have been
                        executed.
  -c filename, --config-filename filename
                        main config filename. (default: "user-sync-
                        config.yml")
  --users [all|file|mapped|group [arg1 ...]]
                        specify the users to be considered for sync. Legal
                        values are 'all' (the default), 'group names' (one or
                        more specified groups), 'mapped' (all groups listed in
                        the configuration file), 'file f' (a specified input
                        file).
  --user-filter pattern
                        limit the selected set of users that may be examined
                        for syncing, with the pattern being a regular
                        expression.
  --update-user-info    if user information differs between the enterprise
                        side and the Adobe side, the Adobe side is updated to
                        match.
  --process-groups      if membership in mapped groups differs between the
                        enterprise directory and Adobe sides, the group
                        membership is updated on the Adobe side so that the
                        memberships in mapped groups match those on the
                        enterprise directory side.
  --adobe-only-user-action [exclude|preserve|write-file|delete|remove|remove-adobe-groups [arg1 ...]]
                        specify what action to take on Adobe users that don't
                        match users from the directory. Options are 'exclude'
                        (from all changes), 'preserve' (as is except for
                        --process-groups, the default), 'write-file f'
                        (preserve and list them), 'remove-adobe-groups' (but
                        do not remove users)'remove' (users but preserve cloud
                        storage), 'delete' (users and their cloud storage),
  --adobe-only-user-list input_path
                        instead of computing Adobe-only users (Adobe users
                        with no matching users in the directory) by comparing
                        Adobe users with directory users, the list is read
                        from a file (see --adobe-only-user-action write-file).
                        When using this option, you must also specify what you
                        want done with Adobe-only users by also including
                        --adobe-only-user-action and one of its arguments
  --config-file-encoding ENCODING_NAME
                        config files are expected to contain only ASCII
                        characters; if you use an extended character set
                        (e.g., to specify group names), then specify the
                        encoding of your configuration files with this
                        argument. All encoding names understood by Python are
                        allowed.
  --test-framework live|test
                        sets user-sync in test framework mode. Output is
                        formatted to support test framework,and in live mode,
                        authentication with Adobe servers is skipped.
