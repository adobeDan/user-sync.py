user_sync:
    # (required) arguments (no default value)
    # Defines the arguments used when invoking the user-sync tool. The relative path in this argument is relative to
    # working directory defined below.
    arguments: -c ../../../config-common/user-sync-config.yml --update-user-info --users file ../../../config-common/users.csv

    # Defines settings for test framework running in live mode.
    live:
        # (optional) working_dir (default value "live")
        # Working directory that the user-sync tool is set to when it is invoked at the start of the test.
        # working_dir: live

        # (optional) output_dir (default value "live/out")
        # Directory that will be considered the output folder. Typically when specifying user-sync output arguments for
        # the test cases you would place it in an output folder, such as user-sync "--adobe-only-user-action
        # write-file out/test.csv". By default, the user-sync output will be written to live/out/out.txt, unless
        # this output folder or working folder is changed.
        # TODO: instead of specifying the output folder, this parameter will be renamed output_filename, which would
        # default to out/out.txt, and 
        # output_dir: live/out

    test:
        # (optional) working_dir (default value "test")
        # Same as /user_sync/live/working_dir, but represents the working directory for when running in the framework
        # test mode instead of live mode.
        # working_dir: test

        # (optional) output_dir (default value "test/out")
        # Same as /user_sync/live/output_dir, but represents the output directory for when running the framework in
        # test mode.
        # output_dir: test/out

server:
    # (optional) cassette_filename (default value "live/cassette.yml")
    # Cassette file that will be used by the proxy server when recording requests/responses when running the framework
    # in live mode, or for matching requests and returning responses to the user-sync tool when the framework is in
    # recorded mode.
    # cassette_filename: live/cassette.yml

verification:
    # (optional) text_files (default value is empty list)
    # A list of files to look for as output from running the command, which will be tested for equality against the
    # same file from the live output. Only applicable when running in test mode.
    # text_files:
    #     - user_list1.csv

    # (optional) unordered_text_files (default value is empty list)
    # same as text_files above, but doesn't expect the lines of text in the file to be in teh same order. The lines
    # are sorted before the content is tested for equality.
    # unordered_text_files:
    #     - user_list2.csv

    configuration_output:
        # (optional) temp_path (default value is None)
        # specifies folder where the user-sync configuration files outputs the log files, and treats the destination
        # like a temporary path. The folder is cleared before running user-sync. This path references is relative to
        # the parent directory of the main user-sync configuration file.
        # temp_path = '../../config-common/temp'

        # (optional) temp_freeze_path (default value is None)
        # specifies the folder in which to duplicate the temp file output to, relative to the live or test output
        # folder, for later verification.
        # temp_freeze_path: 'config'

        # (optional) filtered_log_files (default value is empty list)
        # specifies a list of regular expressions used to identify log files to compare, in both the live and test
        # output files. The file must be in the test's output folder, and each filter must result in one match on both
        # the live and test output files, in order to identify which files to compare.
        # filtered_log_files:
        #     - .*\.log$
